Competent bosses make for happier workers!
- This makes sense, but does the data bear it out, or are we just assuming?

What data?!?
- We have three sources:
  1. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1990
  2. Working in Britain Survey 2000
  3. NLSY 1979-1988

What is measured?
- The paper is mainly focused on job satisfaction as it relates to many different factors.
- Although, they ran the numbers with other measures of well-being, too:
  - you are given a chance to do your best (t-value: 19.29)
  - Job security (t-value: 17.66)
  - Chances for promotion (t-value: 26.82)
  - Physical surroundings (t-value: 18.17)
  - Pay is good (t-value: 15.60)

What is boss competence?
- There is no one definition, so we show it through a couple different measures:
  - Has the supervisor worked their way up the ranks, or owns the company? (using NLSY 1990 6,000 employees)
  - Could your supervisor do your job? (WiBS 2000 1,600 employees)
  - Does the supervisor know their job well? (WiBS 2000 1,600 employees)
  - Is your supervisor competent in doing their job? (NLSY 1979-82, 88, 27,000 employees)

How'd they generalize?
- They controlled for "cheery employees by asking if their co-workers were friendly)
- They picked one sample of employees that stay at the same job, but switched supervisors.
- They used instrumental-variable estimates of college degree and working your way up.

What did they find?
- They found that boss competence mattered more for older workers.
- Competence bosses improve well being regardless of small (<50) or large companies.
- The same holds true regardless of the gender of the boss or the employee.

Objections?
Q: What if some folks are too happy when they take the survey?
A: That cannot account for all the participants, nor would it predict that the IV estimation would work.

Q: The data is not randomly assigned.
A: True, more work is done, but the results hold for the longitudinal study and they chose strong instruments (?)

Q: The data doesn't support the conceptual framework in the appendix.
A: Maybe, but the framework, we think stands on it's own, and the data fits it.

Q: The IV estimate instruments could not be the best.
A: We believe that working your way up is a good indicator.

Q: Isn't this all subjective?
A: Nah, employees for the most part answer truthfully, and the factual questions, like "Did your supervisor work their way up?" are completely objective.

More work in this field is needed. Amanda Goodall, and Agnes Baker have two new papers coming out soon that confirm this theory in universities and hospitals.

Apendix: The framework.

Assume that a firm gets output when a worker AND a supervisor take action together. The worker's action is a, the supervisor's action is s, so the output for the firm Q can be the production function:

    Q = q(a, s)

Assume that the worker gets psi amount of the output in the form of pay. Then the worker's utility can be stated as:

    mu = mu(a, s, psiQ) - c(a)

where c is the cost function of the action a.

If the supervisor's amount of the output in the form of pay is called sigma, the supervisor's utility can be:

    va = va(a, s, sigmaQ) - k(s)

where k is the cost function of the action s.

to simplify notation:

    mu(a, s, psiQ) = u(a, s)
    va(a, s, sigmaQ) = v(a, s)

So the two parties' net utility are:

    u(a, s) - c(a)
    v(a, s) - k(s)

OK.
