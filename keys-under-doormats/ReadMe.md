The paper that caught my attention is is _Keys Under Doormats_ a paper 
published in November of 2015 that was co-authored by Susan Landau, 
Peter G. Neumann, Whitfield Diffie, et. al. 

This paper is the most recent of a series of scholarly papers which
discusses the risks to the general public that are created when the
U.S. Government requests or issues mandates for technology changes
to provide "greater security". 

These papers published going back to at least 1994 discuss the trade
offs between the desired result, the privacy of individuals and
the overall reliability of the targeted technology (such as
cell phones, internet traffic, etc.) I found the cycle of mandates
and responses to be quite complex and compelling. There are many
actions and consequences that are non-obvious at first glance and
these papers do a good job of explaining these relationships.

Other papers that enter into this dicussion are:
 * _National Security on the Line_, May 2006
 * _The Real National-Security Needs for VoIP_, November 2005
 * _Codes, Keys and Conflicts: Issues in U.S. Crypto Policy_, June 1994
 
 *Note:* Treveor, I suggested the paper _National Security on the Line_, but
 I meant to propose the most recent paper _Keys Under Doormats_. I hope
 that this is alright.
